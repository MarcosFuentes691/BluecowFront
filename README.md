# Bluecow front
Front end of web application to keep track of Hearthstone Battlegrounds games and to display various stats.Back end and more information available at https://github.com/MarcosFuentes691/Bluecow2Back

Deployed online at https://bluecowhs.herokuapp.com/ (It's not using any paid databases or services so it may be a bit slow, specially the first time you load it).

*You can try out the app using your own account or you could use a prepopulated account(email:dummy@email.com, password:dummy)*

###Here's a brief explanation of how a game works so that you can understand the app better(A more detailed guide/readme is coming soon) :

-Hero: There is a variety of different heroes of which you choose one to play each game.

-Position: Each game is played by 8 players, so your position can be from 1 to 8.

-MMR: MMR stands for match making rating, so in short this is a rating that defines each player skill, after each game
depending how well you did this rating is going to either grow or lower. Here you have to enter how your MMR is after the game.

-Date: Date of which the game was played, you can choose to either use the date of the moment you enter a game or
to enter a custom date. (*functionality to enter a custom date in Mozilla might not work properly so I'm working on changing this*)

-After that you can check various stats in Game history, Hero stats, Personal stats or Day stats. Most of the stats are self explanatory if you understand how a game works, the only one that might not be obvious is *outcome* which depending on what type of stats are you looking it could be MMR gained in a game, with a hero, or in a specific date.
