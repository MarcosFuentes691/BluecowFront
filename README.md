</p>

-Hero: There is a variety of different heroes of which you choose one to play each game.

-Place: Each game is played by 8 players, so your position can be from 1 to 8.

-MMR: MMR stands for match making rating, so in short this is a rating that defines each player skill, after each game
depending how well you did this rating is going to either go up or down, you must enter your MMR when you upload a game.

-Difference: MMR gain or loss compared to the last game, you do not need to enter this when you enter a game, is automatically calculated.
